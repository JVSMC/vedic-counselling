# --| Vedic consuelling |--

Vedic counseling is a dharmic guidance on right living, right action, right relationship, and right 
awareness. Its basis is self-understanding and bringing us to a direct perception of the truth, 
not imposing a belief system, formula, or set of preconceptions upon anyone. It addresses all 
the goals of life from a background of physical and psychological well-being.
Vedic counseling may relate to any of the four main goals of life or to wellness as the 
foundation. It includes not only therapeutic approaches but more general life-guidance on all 
levels. This makes it useful for everyone for improving their lives and managing their karma.

+ Dharma, soul purpose and career
+ Artha, goals, values and prosperity
+ Kama, happiness, relationship, creativity
+ Moksha, liberation of consciousness, Yoga, Vedanta and Self-realization
+ Arogya, health and wellness for body and mind, including Ayurveda and Yogic psychology

Vedic counseling is based upon an understanding of dharma, or our individual nature, and 
karma or our patterns of action, and how we can achieve all the main goals of life, including 
right relationship, right vocation and the fulfillment of all our duties and responsibilities to the 
whole of life. Such foundational Vedic knowledge is necessary for any Vedic or yogic 
applications.

As a Vedic counselor we have an understanding of the complete and integral human being 
from the physical body to pure consciousness, from individual to universal existence, along 
with the appropriate tools and practices to create harmony on each level.
the ultimate Vedic goal of life (Moksha), liberation from karma, samsara, rebirth and sorrow.
Regardless of technological advances and AI and its inevitable development, you need to 
understand your true nature in consciousness You are not the body or the mind, you are the 
boundless light of consciousness which pervades all. You hold the entire universe within you. 

You need not bow down or be directed by any machine for understanding your true Self.
Understanding our inner being we can use all instruments from our own minds and senses to 
information all types of technology from a place of wisdom and harmony with all. In this regard 
AI has many benefits but is no substitute for our own introspective Self-awareness that takes 
us to a deeper dimension of awareness
